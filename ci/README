Continuous Integration Configuration Info
=========================================

The following pointers are aimed at maintainers to help describe a few points
about the Cirrus CI setup that may not be obvious/intuitive.

Email Notifications
-------------------

Cirrus CI doesn't feature any way to perform email notifications on failures,
so that is instead handled by a separate GitHub Action:

  https://github.com/zeek/ci-email-action

The configuration of that GitHub Action is typical: it's the
``.github/workflows/ci-notification.yml`` file, which sets SMTP/mail info
via secrets stored in GitHub for the Zeek organization:

  https://github.com/organizations/zeek/settings/secrets

The particular values used for those are currently from the Zeek project's AWS
Simple Email Service configuration.
